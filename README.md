# Rx

Rx is a Rack middleware that provides tiered health checks to any Rack application, including Rails-based apps.

## Tiered Health Checks

What is a tiered health check? I'm glad you asked! Health checks serve different purposes:

- Some are used by load balancers to ensure that a server is capable of serving traffic
- Some are used by other applications to verify the health of your service as a dependency
- Some are used by customers or status pages to determine uptime

These use cases are all similar, but may require different levels of verification. One may require your service to just return 200, while another may need to check connectivity to the database, cache, or external services.

Rx provides three levels of health checks:

1. `/liveness`: A health check that determines if the server is running.
2. `/readiness`: Readiness checks determine if critical, dependent services are running (think a database or cache)
3. `/deep`: A health check that walks your entire dependency tree, checking other critical and secondary services.

### Rails Applications

Add `rx` to your Gemfile, and then create a new initializer with something like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert(
  Rx::Middleware,
    liveness: [Rx::Check::FileSystemCheck.new],
    readiness: [
      Rx::Check::FileSystemCheck.new,
      Rx::Check::ActiveRecordCheck.new,
      Rx::Check::HttpCheck.new("http://example.com"),
      Rx::Check::GenericCheck.new(-> { $redis.ping == "PONG" }, "redis")],
    deep_critical: [Rx::Check::HttpCheck.new("http://criticalservice.com/health")],
    deep_secondary: [Rx::Check::HttpCheck.new("http://otherservice.com/health-check")]
  )
```

### Configuring Dependencies

Now that you're running `rx`, you will need to configure which dependencies it tests in each health check. You can do this by passing `Rx::Check` objects to the middleware. `rx` ships with a number of standard checks:

- Filesystem health
- ActiveRecord
- HTTP
- Generic Check

In addition to the stock checks, you may create your own by copying an existing check
and modifying it (though it's probably simpler to just use GenericCheck).

`RX::Middleware` accepts the following named parameters as configuration:

```ruby
liveness: [],
readiness: [],
deep_critical: [],
deep_secondary: []
```

Each collection must contain 0 or more `Rx::Check` objects. Those checks will be performed when the health check is queried. Deep checks will always also run the readiness checks.

### Cache

For deep health checks Rx by default will use an in-memory cache. While this is useful when running in production, during testing it could lead to unexpected results.
You can disable the in-memory cache by setting the cache key false in the options hash.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert(
  Rx::Middleware,
    liveness: [Rx::Check::FileSystemCheck.new],
    readiness: [
      Rx::Check::FileSystemCheck.new,
      Rx::Check::ActiveRecordCheck.new,
      Rx::Check::HttpCheck.new("http://example.com"),
      Rx::Check::GenericCheck.new(-> { $redis.ping == "PONG" }, "redis")],
    deep_critical: [Rx::Check::HttpCheck.new("http://criticalservice.com/health")],
    deep_secondary: [Rx::Check::HttpCheck.new("http://otherservice.com/health-check")],
    options: {
      cache: false
    }
  )
```

### Deep end-point authorization

It is considered as a good practice to protect the deep checks with a GUID to mitigate DDOS attacks. Hence you have 2 options to enable this. One is to use the `default_authorization` by passing the token to the authorization inside options hash, which you can use in a request with the authorization_token in the header of it. The other option would be to pass a lambda with an env argument (this gives you access to hash of request data) and have your own `custom_authorization`:

```ruby
options: {
  #default
  authorization: <token>

  #custom
  authorization: -> (env) {
    #your code goes here
  }
 }
```

Some tips for developing the gem locally:

- Tests can be run by calling `rake`
- You can point your Rails app to a local gem by adding a `path` option to your Gemfile, a la `gem "rx", path: "path/to/rx" (though you _will_ need to restart Rails whenever you change the gem).
